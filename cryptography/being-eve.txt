Sean Lee - Being Eve

===Diffie Hellman===

The shared secret agreed upon by Alice and Bob was determined to be 12. Work is shown in the pdf file. I figured out the shared secret by following the diagram between Alice and Bob as they figure out A and B. And then I figured out the equations to be 5 = 17^b mod61 and 46 = 17^a mod61. Then using wolfram, I solved this equation and found a = 74 and b = 86. With this I, figured out that the shared secret key was 12. If the B and A values that Bob and Alice sent to each other were much larger, this process would not have worked because no system would be able to compute the equations in a reasonable amount of time.

The encrypted message is 'Dear Bob, Check this out.  https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/12/e-mail_tracking_1.html Yikes! Your friend, Alice'. Work is shown on the pdf and the python file. To figure out the message, I had to first figure out p_B and q_B by brute forcing the calculations. Then I was able to figure out d_B by using wolfram which turned out to be 2335. With d_B I could then take each integer in Alice's ciphertext and write a Python program that will compute the equation for each integer and then decrypt the message. If n_B was too large, my process would have failed because it could have taken a much much longer time to brute force my way into finding the values of p_B and q_B.
